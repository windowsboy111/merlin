## Definition

- It is not intended for public use but developers.
- Things can change a lot between Nightly builds
- Documentations / notifications might not be given apon a nightly commit.
## Changelogs
- as the master branch is a stable release, all changes for nightly will be staged inside the normal CHANGELOG.md file.
## Versioning
- versioning in nightly will works like before -- build number will increases slowly (maybe 1 to 5 for each commit)
- for master, it will only get a pull request when a new release is ready
