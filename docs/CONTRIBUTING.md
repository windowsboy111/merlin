# CONTRIBUTING TO MERLIN (Python)  
Thank you for supporting Merlin! I'm glad you are trying to contribute to this piece of open source code!
# Before contributing, you better...
- you should have a good understanding how Merlin works... at least discord.py
- join our [discord guild](https://discord.io/kccs)
- maybe also the [testing guild](https://discord.gg/cRH2kcS)!
# Testing
- well, Merlin originally is intended for only the KCCS Official discord guild, but it might not suit for other guilds. [Invite Merlin](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=690839099648638977&permissions=8&scope=bot) to your guild and test it out!
# Submitting changes
- To submit your changes, create a new issue, see if you get +1 from our staff / bot owners
- fork the repo
- make changes / edits on the forked version
- issue a pull request, merging yours to the original one.
# Coding conventions  
We optimize the readability:
- 4 spaces for indentation (a tab)
- avoid speghetti codes and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- use common sense. put spaces after an comma (`,`) and around operators. new lines might be neccesary
- refer syntax rules to PEP8


Thanks
